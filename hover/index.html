Judgement of what was said at the Round Table is invited in terms of these general purposes.

Describing the meeting later, one of the participants put it this way: "There in that room, were a bunch of guys trying to think. We were most of us prima donnas, and from time to time we stopped thinking to try to pull off an epigram. But still––a bunch of guys trying to think. Still more difficult, we were trying to think aloud and trying to communicate with each other––trying to get things clear that have never been gotten clear."

Three sessions were scheduled for the first two days; an unscheduled fourth session was added the third day at the request of some participants. The second session was open by invitation to the public and to members of the San Francisco Art Association; the three other sessions were closed.
